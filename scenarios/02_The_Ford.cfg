            story= _ "Tragtrad fled as fast as he could, for he knew that Fal Khag could not tolerate another orc claiming the bloodthorn throne, Tragtrad’s throne. Grimly, he mustered his own followers, just a small group of true, strong orcs were with him, his closest cousins. First and foremost, Umaduro assisting with wise counsel. Otherwise, he had only a handful of weak, inexperienced, and dull orcs. Not even goblins were to be found, those pissers were too fearful to not stay with the strongest. But that meant he would have no wolf riders in the foreseeable future. Well, at least none of 'them' are going to challenge him, he thought with gallows humor.

           story= _ "The smarty, Umaduro, suggested seeking the aid of a troll clan, but all their attempts proved unsuccessful. Trolls were reluctant to leave their caves unless compelled, and Tragtrad lacked the manpower to force them. His only option was to earn glory and honor through battle, to prove himself and triumph over his enemies. Then orcs would follow him again! Luckily his own ragtag group found a massive horde of orcs, that wanted to plunder the human kingdom of Wesnoth. Seeing a chance for glory, Tragtrad agreed to follow with his orcs the orders of a 'Rormuk the Butcher', hoping to emulate Fal Khag and claim not just a share of the glory, but all of it.
