#Well at least the pathic rest of Rormukâ€™s horde was following him now, probably to a freezing death but who cares about their lives. His own life however did not seem any further away from death. It has now been weeks they have been searching foothills to look after a probable lie of his human prisoner, but what other option did he have? He had told of a fortress in the mountains where they would be safe from the weather. He could not check in any way if there was even a kernel of truth in this.

First, it was the weight of responsibility bearing down on him, then the looming shadow of Fal Khag, and now the relentless pursuit of the humans. But amidst the chaos, Tragtrad sought solace in the silver linings. Most of Rormuk's horde now trailed behind him, a ragged band of survivors clinging to his leadership. Among them was the welcome addition of goblin riders again, easing his fears of ambush lurking around every corner. Also, this time, when his horde encountered a troll clan in trouble, he had more than enough orcs to bully them into fighting for him, meaning he now commanded a true orc army, including trolls. Tragtrad thought on his ideas and ambitions, seeking a path to plunder Wesnoth for his own glory was the only way, it was Karzahn's dream to be avenged, as a bloodthorn Tragtrad had no other option, he needed to fight Wesnoth, he needed to be the one to end Wesnoth as it was right now, every bloodthorn would follow him, if he could accomplish that task.

Their raid on the humans was poorly timed, for logistical reasons and because the mountain passes only allowed it then, usually the orcs attacked in the spring, giving them more than enough time to return home and find shelter. Yet now it was already winter and they did not know where to go, as the biting cold beat down relentlessly on longlegged and shortlegged alike, he thought of Fal Khag, whose untimely challenge to his leadership was the reason for the perilous situation they now found themselves in, he was the reason why his horde was succumbing to the cold, he was the reason why Tragtrad could not return home to his nephews (assuming he had enough time), he was the reason!

As Tragtrad grew more desperate with the cold, he began to question his prisoner. The prisoner spoke of a fortress in the mountains that promised a warm hearth and protection from the harsh elements. Tragtrad feared a trap, but he had no choice, for he knew that the elements were a merciless enemy that would not refrain from leaving more and more frozen corpses on the ground. With the spectre of impending doom breathing down his neck, Tragtrad walked on, frantically searching the mountainsides to find the shelter.
