Even worse, he himself, his cousins former chief advisor, was sidelined more and more, and even excluded from Tragtrads meetings with the prisoners. Culminating on the day, that Umaduro saw Orion go free.

During the day, place some cannon-fodder grunts that will mostly fall, but deal a lot of damage with your strong units during the night. Don't forget to maximize your healing.
