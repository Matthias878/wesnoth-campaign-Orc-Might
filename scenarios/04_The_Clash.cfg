The amount of fighters under Tragtrads command tremendously increased, since many a lost orcs or those who had fled some other fight sought shelter in the warm castle of the mages and Tragtrad took them all. Umaduro was also sent with gold to hire the assasins Orion talked about.

Tragtrad spent too much time with his prisoners, talking and talking long nights with them and making plans, but he wouldn't tell his own cousin what they were. Until finally Umaduro saw Orion go free. Umaduro confronted Tragtrad but he was only blocked.
