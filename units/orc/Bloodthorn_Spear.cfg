    description= _ "While most orcs favor heavy blades plundered from their many enemies, some true orcs in the Bloodthorn clans choose spears, painstakingly crafted by their weakly halfkin, as their weapons of choice. Armed with nothing but these deadly pikes, any foe can be struck down, particularly in hilly terrain, where these orcs feel most at home. They sacrifice armor for mobility, though."
