    description= _ "Experienced orcs often learn that the best chance of survival lies in knowing when to strike. Caught between the relentless onslaught of dwarven hammers from the Heart Mountains and the precise strikes of elvish bows in Lintair Forest, the fighters of the Bloodthorn clan quickly learned the need to adapt or perish. In the hills, the orcish trailblazers have begun to use the axe as their main weapon."
