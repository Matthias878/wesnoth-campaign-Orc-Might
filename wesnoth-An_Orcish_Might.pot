"Fleeing, running away! Again! Why must he always be running from something? Tragtrad could never catch a break. First, it was the weight of responsibility bearing down on him, then the looming shadow of Fal Khag, and now the relentless pursuit of the humans. But amidst the chaos, Tragtrad sought solace in the silver linings. Most of Rormuk's horde now trailed behind him, a ragged band of survivors clinging to his leadership. Among them was the welcome addition of goblin riders again, easing his fears of ambush lurking around every corner. Also, this time, when his horde encountered a troll clan in trouble, he had more than enough orcs to bully them into fighting for him, meaning he now commanded a true orc army, including trolls. Tragtrad thought on his ideas and ambitions, seeking a path to plunder Wesnoth for his own glory was the only way, it was Karzahn's dream to be avenged, as a bloodthorn Tragtrad had no other option, he needed to fight Wesnoth, he needed to be the one to end Wesnoth as it was right now, every bloodthorn would follow him, if he could accomplish this task. He found himself drawn to his prisoner for more information about the human kingdom, however the captive gnawed at his resolve, fueled by the human's assessments about the strength and especially number of humans soldiers.\n"

The fleeing told those orcs waiting for Tragtrad what had happened and there was no compassion from the half-dead orcs, they killed all they saw and left no woman, child or old one alive. The horse lords caught them, when they were trying to cross the Ford, the same one they had already tried to cross a year before. They were worn down to almost the last orc in the water. The task of rebuilding the destroyed and depopulated Parthyn was given to a local family of farmers, that owned a lot of farmland. The Keshars..."

Some say that was what brought him down, but most likly he was just never able to establish himself as supreme over the barons. The king after him immediately revoked the barony of Parthyn from Manmas' family (and thus also ending the dynasty of Haldric I, well at least the male line...) The rundown barony of Parthyn was given to the Keshars as to continue rebuilding Parthyn."

But its curiosity won out and the child came into possession of a power long unseen in Wesnoth. It took some time, but the royal court took notice, and from that day on, the child's life worsened dramatically, especially after the death of it's greatest benefactor, the former king himself. With its power, however, the child rose in position, and as it grew older, it became the consort of the heir to Haldric, a position never before dreamed of. Most say it was a love match, but as with many young lovebirds, a quarrel brought misfortune, in this case misfortune for all of Wesnoth."
